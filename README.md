# fixany

Fixany is an AI app that empowers users to create, save, and improve custom commands. With a focus on user experience, it offers features like command storage, editing, and reuse. Our "Fix anything" tagline reflects our commitment to problem-solving.

Beyond AI, Fixany promotes sustainability by helping users repair items through image analysis. To achieve this, we use the Gemini API. We also prioritize inclusivity with features like text-to-speech and accessible controls.

Fixany is more than an app; it's a tool for creativity and efficiency. Future plans include command sharing to build a global community.
